    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website was designed to help broiler growers compare different light emitting diode (LED) bulbs

(scientifically referred to as lamps)  tested with different dimmers to provide a score to be used as one

of several factors in choosing the most appropriate LED and dimmer combinations for their broiler

house(s).  Each bulb and dimmer combination is given a score of 1-100. Scores in the range of 85-97?

(determine statistical range) should be considered as very good matches (statistically similar). This score

should be just one of several factors when choosing a bulb and dimmer combination. Other important

considerations are listed under <a href=addl.php>Additional Information.</a></p></div>
